# Auto-text-animation
## How it works?
#### Just enter the attribute in the text tag: `data-speed` with a speed in ms.
#### You can also add `data-infinity='true'` attribute for infinite animation.
#### Don't forget to connect the script to html.
## Example:
### Default:
```html
  <h1 data-speed="500">Hellow world</h1>
```
### Infinity:
```html
  <h1 data-speed="500" data-infinity='true'>Hellow world</h1>
```
